PLACEHOLDER FILE

This file is a placeholder for the actual GlyphMatrixSDK.aar file that must be obtained from Nothing's developer program.

To get the actual SDK file:
1. Apply to Nothing's developer program
2. Download the GlyphMatrixSDK
3. Replace this placeholder file with the actual GlyphMatrixSDK.aar

The project will not build without the actual SDK file.
