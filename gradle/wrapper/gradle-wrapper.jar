PLACEHOLDER FILE

This file is a placeholder for the actual gradle-wrapper.jar file.

The gradle-wrapper.jar is a binary file that gets downloaded automatically when you run:
./gradlew wrapper

Or you can initialize it by running:
gradle wrapper

This JAR file contains the Gradle wrapper runtime and is required for the build system to work properly.
